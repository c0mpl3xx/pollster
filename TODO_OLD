Every ajax thing should have an indicator
PRESS ENTER BUTTON ON TEXT FIELD IN CREATOR SUBMITS FORM HENCE CREATING POLL PRE-MATURELY O FUCK
WTF IS THIS make stats on the poll view

we should be able to control what we can and cant see int he activity feed, at the moment there is way too much info going on!
top friends function on friends list
can we search for a user and their polls?
what is user profile for?
placement of user login and new mail stuff in header
 
maybe you already have this but can i compare friends voting similarity and rank them or users that vote like me 92% of the time

add some informative/useful text to profile page

Only one video - pbob

add 'SEPERATE BY COMMA' HELP TEXT  for interests, about, etc, on demo editor on user profile
crate method to reconcile tags added like this 'palin fey politics alasksa'
safari crash, google ad problem?


lengthen file input boxes on creator
re-sort answers (drag/drop) during creation
Delete a poll
user name somehow on friend icons!!!!!!
max file size for uploads
apache config
poll lister, display the poll specially if it was made by your friend
auto add friend thingie

your poll is up 25% today in popularity

more link for friends
user setting: allow other users to see what you are watching
user setting: hide help icons	
lightbox edit profile picture page
setting for allowing whether people can view polls uve voted on or not

HALF-DONE tag browsing: filter/surf modes
demographic security: as user filles it out, they should be 
	able to hide each one individually from users (but they still show up during poll filters, 
	although at that time it cannot be traced back to user)
Add demographic view (done?)
demos: Add And functionality
demos: Add OR functionality
		instead of getting all votes filter it down to to use a subset of voters 
		based on a criteria of demographics that can be && and || together.
Add answers vs time view


about the display format, we were thinking long term like advertisers can even use your website for market research or to boost their product ie, 'a widespread poll on pollstruck gave coke 28% more 'pollcats' than pepsi' -not pollcats but something gimmiky, and display it with small cartoons??
-Maybe to consider when creating poll rankings
It would be nice to be able to change your answers to the polls on the fly.
